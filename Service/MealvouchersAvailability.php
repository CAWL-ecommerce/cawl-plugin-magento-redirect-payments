/**
 * Mealvouchers availability, evaluated against a quote that already carries an address.
 *
 * These rules used to sit in ConfigProvider. That runs once, when /checkout renders, which is
 * before the shopper has entered anything: measured on a guest checkout, the quote has no billing
 * country at that point, so the rules were decided against empty values and the method could not
 * appear. The payment_method_is_active observer is the first point where the address is populated,
 * so the rules live here and are called from there.
 *
 * There is deliberately no email condition. merchantCustomerId is not mandatory for this method,
 * and a guest's email is not on the server at all while the payment list is being built - Magento
 * receives it as an argument of GuestPaymentInformationManagement::savePaymentInformation() and
 * only then writes it to the billing address, from where QuoteManagement copies it onto the quote.
 * The order therefore always carries an email; the payment step simply cannot see it yet.
